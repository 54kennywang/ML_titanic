# Kaggle Challenge: Titanic

This was my first ML project after taking the course [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) on Coursera.

In the project, I mainly explored the area of different data processing and feature engineering techniques as in `feature_engineering.py` and `Advanced_feature_engineering_refactored.py`, including feature selection, missing data handling, categorical data to ordinal data conversion by mapping. Besides, I also studied the stacking technique as in `stacking.py`. `stacking` is defined with the specific example in `stacking.py`.

The highest accuracy rate was 0.80861, achieved using feature engineering with 5 layers of stacking. This ranks top 5% in the leadboard of the challenge.

Throughout this project, much of indepedent studies was done on the understading of different statistical concepts and various models, the summarys can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1w2Nknj5MbX5UvuxscXWsONQQGftPeUV5?usp=sharing).
